        <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>
        <p>You probably know that the operating system <strong>Android</strong>, maintained by <strong>Google</strong> is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot. </p>
                
        <h2>The First Version</h2>
        
        <p>The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened the <a href="https://inkscape.org/pt-br/#explorar-recursos" target="_blank " class="externo">Inkscape</a>(free software for image vectorization) and created his own robot version. The goal was just to embody the system just for your team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <img src="images/dan-droids.png" alt="The First Android Mascot"></picture>
        
        <p>This first bizarre version was even named in honor of its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>A New Mascot Appears</h2>
        
        <p>The idea of ​​having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. The Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

            <img src="images/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok, creator of bugdroid
            "></picture>
        
        <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. Then came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the Android's new mascot.</p>
        
        <img src="images/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="Bugdroid">
        
        <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating on her desk in the <strong>Google</strong> and looked to the side of the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>
